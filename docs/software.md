## Lethe ![Lethe logo](assets/lethe-logo-with-bkgd.png){ width="600" align=right }

**Lethe** is an open-source finite-element framework for multiphysics and multiphase flow simulations.  
It is designed for **high-performance computing** and includes advances features such as **mesh adaptation** and **dynamic load balancing**.

Lethe provides:
- Matrix-free stabilized solvers for incompressible Navier–Stokes equations  
- Multiphase capabilities (VOF)
- Discrete Element Method (DEM) solvers for granular and particulate flows  
- Coupled CFD-DEM and conjugate heat transfer capabilities  
- Advanced features for **additive manufacturing**, **process intensification**, and **particle transport**

Lethe is developed in C++ and built upon the deal.II finite-element library.  
All code is released under a dual **Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception** or **LGPL-2.1-or-later** license.

## deal.II

![deal.II logo](assets/dealii.png){ width="150" align=right }

**deal.II** is a C++ program library targeted at the computational solution of partial differential equations using adaptive finite elements. It uses state-of-the-art programming techniques to offer you a modern interface to the complex data structures and algorithms required.

Key characteristics:
- Object-oriented, extensible architecture   
- Interfaces to major solver packages such as **Trilinos**, **PETSc**, and **p4est**  

deal.II serves as the foundation for Lethe’s core numerical infrastructure.  
The CHAOS Laboratory contributes actively to its ongoing development.

## 🌍 Open-Science Philosophy

At CHAOS Lab, we believe that **reproducibility and transparency** are cornerstones of scientific progress.  
All our numerical methods, benchmarks, and simulation tools are released under open licenses and developed in public repositories.
