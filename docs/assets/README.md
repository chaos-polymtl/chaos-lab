# Logo Placeholder

## Instructions

Please add your Chaos Laboratory logo file to this directory with the following name:

```
logo.png
```

### Requirements

- **Format:** PNG (recommended) or other web-compatible formats
- **Recommended size:** 200x200 pixels or larger (will be scaled automatically)
- **Transparency:** Use transparent background for best results
- **File name:** Must be named `logo.png` (or update the reference in `mkdocs.yml`)

### Usage

The logo is configured in the `mkdocs.yml` file and will appear:

- In the navigation header (top-left corner)
- As the site favicon
- On the home page

### Alternative Configurations

If you have multiple logo files or want to use different formats:

1. Place your logo file in this `docs/assets/` directory
2. Update the `mkdocs.yml` file:
   - Change the `theme.logo` path
   - Change the `theme.favicon` path if using a different favicon

### Temporary Placeholder

Until you add your logo, the site will use the Material theme's default icon.
