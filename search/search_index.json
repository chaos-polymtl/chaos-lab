We leverage Eulerian\u2013Lagrangian (CFD\u2013DEM) coupling to accurately capture fluid-solid interactions under realistic industrial conditions.  Applications range from spinning disc reactors, fluidized beds to additive manufacturing processes. The group combines large-scale simulations, and algorithmic innovation with experimental validation to improve predictive capabilities for chemical and manufacturing processes.</p> Physics of Multiphase Flows <p>      We use simulation and experiments to shed light on the physics of multiphase flows (both fluid\u2013fluid and particle-laden flows). This knowledge guides the design or optimization of unit operations and manufacturing processes involving such flows.    </p> Multiphysics Simulations <p>      Our research in multiphysics modelling focuses on the coupling of thermal, electromagnetic, fluid, and reactive phenomena to simulate and optimize complex engineering processes.
